## Cipher Puzzle Website: playing around with audio plugins, timers, and increments

*This repo is a trial in using github as a development platform which acts as the host for a live website.*

I'm aiming to create a cipher breaking webgame using Vue.js as my framework and ultimately running a seperate server database to validate cipher solutions. This project is more ore less 50/50 a coding project and an art experiment.

**The [Crickburrow webpage](http://www.crickburrow.com) is a trailhead which leads to another webiste. Solve the cipher to find the real game!**

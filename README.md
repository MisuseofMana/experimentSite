# Experimental site: playing around with audio plugins, timers, and increments

## This repo is a trial in using a github repo as a development platform which acts as the host for a live website.

I'm aiming to create a cipher breaking webgame using Vue.js as my framework and ultimately running a seperate server database to validate cipher solutions. This project is more ore less 50/50 a coding project and an art experiment.
